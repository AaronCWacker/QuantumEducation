    "This material is intended to educate **software engineers** in certain aspects of Quantum Computing, therefore its focus will be on conveying the conceptual ideas in a form digestible to them, and supporting it with exercises to reinforce those concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that pedagogical approach, **this material won't lead with or heavily leverage the concepts and language indigenous to physics and math**, but only in those terms most easily digestible to the modern software engineer.\n",

    "This Jupyter Notebook is <font color=\"red\">**not intended as a stand alone educational vehicle**</font>  - it's meant to be accompanied by a decicated power point deck that contains the main concepts to be presented by an instructor - it is intended as a vehicle for a hands on workshop environment to facilitate learning through a guided experience.\n",

    "1. There is a certain amount of basic Quantum Computing knowledge that is assumed.\n",
    "2. An active internet connection is **always** assumed.\n",
    "3. Online references/links will be provided where appropriate\n",
    "4. References to books will be made where appropriate\n",
    "5. Much of this material is **dense and detailed**, the reader is <font color=\"red\">**cautioned**</font> to be careful and slow to digest the *nuances* of the material."
